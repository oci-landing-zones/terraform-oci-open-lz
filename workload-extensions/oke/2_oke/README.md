| **NAME**         | OKE cluster set-up                                    |
| **OBJECTIVE**        | Provision OCI OKE cluster as a new platform on top of the OKE Landing Zone Extensions. |

## **2. OKE Deployment**

We are going to deploy the OKE Cluster using Terraform configuration. 

We will use Cloud Shell, to simplify the computer configuration. See the full OKE Terraform module [documentation](https://github.com/oracle-terraform-modules/terraform-oci-oke/tree/main/examples) for details.

1. Click the 'Next' button, cloud shell will be open

[![Open in Code Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle-devrel/oci-code-editor-samples/main/images/open-in-code-editor.png)](https://cloud.oracle.com/?region=home&cs_repo_url=https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-landing-zone-operating-entities.git&cs_branch=master&cs_readme_path=workload-extensions/oke/2_oke/README.md&cs_open_ce=false)

2. `$ cd oci-landing-zone-operating-entities/workload-extensions/oke/2_oke/oke_lz_tf`
3. Change the placeholders for the respective **OCIDs** in the oke.tf file 

| Placeholder | Description |

| \<VCN-OKE-OCID> | OCID of OKE VCN deployed in Network Compartment in respective environment. Created in step 1_oke_extension |
| \<SN-CP-OCID> | OCID of Control plane subnet in OKE VCN. Created in step 1_oke_extension. |    
| \<SN-PRIV-LB-OCID> | OCID of private Load Balancer subnet in OKE VCN. Created in step 1_oke_extension. |
| \<SN-WORKERS-OCID> | OCID of workers subnet in OKE VCN. Created in step 1_oke_extension. |
| \<SN-PODS-OCID> | OCID of pods subnet in OKE VCN. Created in step 1_oke_extension. |
| \<NSG-CP-OCID> | OCID of Control plane NSG in OKE VCN. Created in step 1_oke_extension. | 
| \<NSG-INT-LB-OCID> | OCID of private Load Balancer NSG in OKE VCN. Created in step 1_oke_extension. |
| \<NSG-WORKERS-OCID> | OCID of workers NSG in OKE VCN. Created in step 1_oke_extension. |
| \<NSG-PODS-OCID> | OCID of pods NSG in OKE VCN. Created in step 1_oke_extension. |
| \<CMP-NETWORK-OCID> | OCID of Network compartment in respective environment. |

> [!NOTE]
> Make any additional changes needed to customize your cluster. If you have any questions, please refer to the documentation.

5. Run `$ terraform init`
6. Run `$ terraform apply -var="tenancy_ocid=$OCI_TENANCY" -var="region=$OCI_REGION" `. Environment variables are automatically set-up by Cloud shell.

> [!WARNING]
> Be careful to store your `terraform.tfstate` file. This files holds information about Terraform Managed resources. Without it, you won't be able to modify or destroy your Terraform configured infrastructure. Local storage in Cloud Shell is deleted after a period of inactivity.
>
>  To destroy created OKE cluster run `$ terraform destroy -var="tenancy_ocid=$OCI_TENANCY" -var="region=$OCI_REGION" `
